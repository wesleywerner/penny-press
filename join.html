    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Use our <a href="editor.html" target="_blank">handy markdown editor</a>. It spell checks and counts your words.</li>
      <li>Follow the tips and guidelines below</li>
      <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc3KMjMZHlMaqONaG_bXuNSVsIokZTifyULb1xRQhmCKr3h_w/viewform">Submit your article here</a> (send your markdown to us)</li>

    <h1>Tips for writing articles</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Write fun, entertaining or insightful words</li>
      <li>The truth retold</li>
      <li>Embellishment is always good</li>
      <li>Spell check!</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>Format</h1>
    <p>Penny Press is a palindrome of paraphernalia, mimicking old media within the new. We don't really want url's and links in our articles. The exception to this rule is placing adverts, which may have one link, if any.</p>
    <p>Images are displayed grayscale to match our print. Don't worry doing this yourself, our CSS does it for you.</p>
    
    <h1>Articles</h1>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can include one image in your article if you wish</li>
      <li>Images will be saved on to the Penny Press site on publish</li>
      <li>No hard limit on the number of words.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>Adverts</h1>
    <p>Penny Press does not print ads to monetize, they are purely informational, entertaining or made up. They exist to give readers the full press experience.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adverts can contain one web URL, if necessary</li>
      <li>They can have up to one image</li>
      <li>25 words limit</li>
      <li>You need one advert credit to print your ad</li>
      <li>You get one advert credit for every <strong>published</strong> article you wrote</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
    <p>The editor-in-chief reserves the right to deny articles that they think are inflammatory, discriminatory or in bad taste. Of course you <em>will</em> get a chance to fix your article. We really want your words, we just don't want trolls :)</p>
